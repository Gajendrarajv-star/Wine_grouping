# Wine_grouping

This result shows the outcome of clustering the wine dataset into 3 clusters (groups), which is a way of grouping similar wines together based on their features. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cluster Sizes:
Cluster 0 contains 65 wines.
Cluster 2 contains 61 wines.
Cluster 1 contains 51 wines.
Each number represents how many wines were grouped into each of the 3 clusters. The wines in each cluster are more similar to each other based on their characteristics compared to wines in other clusters.

2. Mean Values of Features in Each Cluster:
For each cluster, the table shows the average values of different features (like alcohol content, acidity, ash content, etc.) that describe the wines in that cluster. These features are likely attributes of the wine, like alcohol content, ash levels, color intensity, etc. Here's what the averages tell us:

Cluster 0 (65 wines):
The wines in this group have an average alcohol content of 12.25, which is the lowest compared to other clusters.
The wines in this cluster also have moderate ash content (around 1.89), color intensity (2.97), and proline levels (510.17).
Cluster 1 (51 wines):
The wines in this group tend to have the highest values for many features:
The average alcohol content is 13.13, higher than Cluster 0 but lower than Cluster 2.
They have the highest proline levels (619.06).
These wines also have the highest ash content (3.29), but their color intensity is the highest (7.17), indicating these wines might be darker or richer in color.
Cluster 2 (61 wines):
Wines in this cluster have the highest alcohol content (13.67) on average.
This group also has a high color intensity (5.45), but it's lower than Cluster 1.
Wines in Cluster 2 have the highest proline level (1100.80), which is a distinctive characteristic of these wines compared to the other clusters.
Key Insights:
Cluster 0 wines are generally lower in alcohol content and proline levels, and their color intensity is moderate.
Cluster 1 wines are characterized by their high ash content, rich color intensity, and moderately high proline levels.
Cluster 2 wines have high alcohol content and very high proline levels, making them stand out from the others.
In simple terms, the clustering algorithm has grouped the wines based on similarities in their chemical properties, and each cluster represents a group of wines that share similar characteristics.
